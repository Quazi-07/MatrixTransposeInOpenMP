# MatrixTransposeInOpenMP
This is a C++ program to transpose one matrix into another matrix. The program is reading the numbers of rows, number of columns, print the matrix in console/text flag and number of team size from the command line. This if for performance evaluation to matrix operation in the openMP compiler. For each configuration the sample report includes the single transpose runtime and the average runtime for 5 times. For each sample matrix size i.e 100X100, 1000X1000, and 2000X5000, this report is giving transponse operation time and compute the speedup for team sizes1, 2 and 4. This also give data for Optimization level: -O0, -O1, -O2 using openMP parallelism.
